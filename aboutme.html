    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>I'm a former teacher of German, French and EFL, so you won't be surprised to learn that I'm a language nut. I always enjoyed using technology in my teaching but at some point, I got sick of having ideas for cool apps and websites for learning languages but no one to make them. In the end, I decided I needed to learn thos skills myself so I quit my job and enrolled on the Ironhack Web Dev Bootcamp. I start in October and I'm very excited!</p></article>

    <h3>Where am I going?</h3>
    <p>Once I'm a proficient web developer, I'm hoping to work for a company or a startup where I can combine my coding skills and teaching experience in order to create beautiful but useful things in the education sector.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, though, my goal is to eventually set up my own business and make educational resources. Tech is part of our lives, particularly for young people, and it makes sense to harness that for the greater good. If people can obsessively check into a game every day to harvest crops or click into guild raids, why can't we create similarly-addictive software that also teaches them something at the same time? I've often thought that if my students spent a quarter of the time revising vocab as they do on Snapchat, they'd easily get an A*. Maybe there's a way to achieve that, and maybe that answer lies in tech.</p></article>

    <h3>Fun Facts</h3></article>
    <p>1. I am fluent in English, German and French and am also learning Spanish and Arabic. As a grammar nerd, I love running through verb conjugations.</p>
    <p>2. I have visited 43 countries across Europe, Africa, Asia and North and South America.</p>
    <p>3. I have been struck by lightning. Yes, really. I have the scar on my knee to prove it.</p>
    <p>4. I regularly do pub quizzes and my specialist subjects are language (obviously), music, current affairs and weird random facts.</p>
    <p>5. I used to be a semi-professional bellydancer, and have dabbled in a lot of world dance including bollywood and hula. These days, I'm learning Lindy Hop and Charleston.</p>
