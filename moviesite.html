  	<h2>Synopsis</h2>
  	<p>Aspiring actress Eve Harrington maneuvers her way into the lives of Broadway star Margo Channing, playwright Lloyd Richards and director Bill Sampson. This classic story of ambition and betrayal has become part of American folklore. Bette Davis claims to have based her character on the persona of film actress Talullah Bankhead. Davis' line "Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night" is legendary, but, in fact, all of the film's dialog sparkles with equal brilliance.</p>
  	<h2>Quotes</h2>
  	<p>"You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point."</p>
  	<p>"There are very few moments in life as good as this. Let's remember it. To each of us and all of us, never have we been more close, may we never be farther apart."</p>
  	<p>"I don't agree, Addison." "That happens to be your particular abnormality."</p>
  	<p>"Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice normal woman who just shoots her husband."</p>
  	<p>"Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worry too much about your heart. You can always put that award where your heart ought to be."</p>
